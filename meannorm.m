function [norm_feats, norm_vec] = meannorm(feats, N, mask)
%MEANNORM  Peak-based mean normalization for missing-data methods.
%   [NORM_FEATS, NORM_VEC] = MEANNORM(FEATS) returns a mean-normalized
%   version of FEATS, as well as the normalization coefficient vector.
%   A fraction of 1/5 of the data surrounding the highest maxima on
%   each channel is used to compute the normalization.
%
%   [...] = MEANNORM(FEATS, N) additionally specifies the
%   normalization parameter such that a fraction of 1/N is used
%   instead.
%
%   [...] = MEANNORM(FEATS, N, MASK) further restricts the
%   normalization to take into account only values for which the
%   binary mask MASK is true.
%
%   The details of the feature normalization can be found in Palom√§ki
%   et al., "Techniques for handling convolutional distortion with
%   'missing data' automatic speech recognition". Speech
%   Communication, 43(1-2), pp. 123-142, 2004.
